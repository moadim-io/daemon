# moadim

> **Loop engineering, on a schedule.** Stop prompting your agents — design the loop that prompts them.
>
> **Cron jobs that run while you sleep.** One port. Three interfaces. Zero drift.
>
> _Set the loop. Forget the keyboard. moadim fires the prompt so you don't have to._

**One-line install** — install Rust/Cargo, install moadim, then run it:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y && . "$HOME/.cargo/env" && cargo install moadim && moadim
```

Rust server that exposes cron job management over three interfaces simultaneously:

- **UI** (`http://localhost:5784/`) — browser dashboard for managing jobs
- **REST** (`http://localhost:5784/api/v1`) — standard HTTP API for browsers, CLI tools, and services
- **MCP** (`http://localhost:5784/mcp`) — [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for AI agents (Claude, etc.)

All three share the same port. Jobs created through any interface are automatically synced to the OS crontab so they actually run on schedule.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install moadim
```

If `moadim` is not found after install, add Cargo's bin directory to your PATH:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then run:

```sh
moadim
```

This starts the server **in the background** and returns control to your shell.
Stop it later with `moadim stop` (or the STOP button in the UI). To run it
attached to your terminal instead, use `moadim --interactive`.

## Features

> _Close the loop. Skip the keyboard. Loop engineering, shipped as a daemon._

- Jobs created via REST or MCP are written into your OS crontab automatically
- Job declarations live in `~/.config/moadim/jobs/` — git-trackable, diff-friendly
- Handlers are executable scripts in `~/.config/moadim/handlers/` — any language, also git-trackable
- `job.local.toml` per job for secrets and machine-specific overrides that stay off-git
- Same REST and MCP interface — no logic duplication between protocols
- API spec auto-generated at build time into `apis/`

## Crontab sync

> _Your crontab, your rules — moadim keeps its own block in sync._

Moadim owns a single block inside your crontab. Everything outside that block is untouched.

```
# BEGIN MOADIM
# Managed by moadim — edits here are overwritten on the next sync
30 9 * * 1-5 /home/user/.config/moadim/handlers/send-report # moadim:uuid
0 0 * * 0 /home/user/.config/moadim/handlers/cleanup-temp # moadim:uuid
# END MOADIM
```

**Forward sync (moadim → crontab):** any time you create, update, or delete a job via the UI, REST, or MCP, the crontab block is rewritten immediately. Disabled jobs are excluded from the block.

**Reverse sync (crontab → moadim) is not currently enabled.** Edit jobs through the UI, REST, or MCP rather than by hand: manual changes inside the block do **not** sync back into moadim and are overwritten by the next forward sync. (The reverse-sync parser exists but is not wired to run — tracked in [#218](https://github.com/moadim-io/daemon/issues/218).)

**Schedule format:** standard 5-field cron (`min hour dom month dow`), same as the OS crontab. `@keyword` shortcuts (`@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@yearly`, `@annually`) are also accepted. `@reboot` and `@midnight` are **not** supported via the API and are rejected with `400 Bad Request`.

**Timezone:** because jobs run via the OS crontab, schedules are evaluated in the host's **local system timezone**, not UTC. A schedule of `0 9 * * *` fires at 09:00 local time. AI agents in particular should not pre-convert times to UTC.

## Handlers

Handlers are executable scripts under `~/.config/moadim/handlers/`. The `handler` field in `job.toml` is the filename without extension.

```
handlers/send-report.sh      ← handler = "send-report"
handlers/cleanup-temp.py     ← handler = "cleanup-temp"
```

Any executable works — shell, Python, Node, compiled binary. The server passes job metadata as environment variables prefixed with `MOADIM_`.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ~/.config/moadim/handlers/send-report.sh

curl -s -X POST "https://api.example.com/report" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOADIM_API_KEY" \
  -d "recipient=$MOADIM_RECIPIENT"
```

Multiple jobs can share one handler, differing only in schedule or metadata:

```
jobs/daily-report/job.toml   → handler = "send-report"
jobs/weekly-digest/job.toml  → handler = "send-report"
```

Handlers are git-trackable alongside jobs:

```sh
cd ~/.config/moadim
git add jobs/ handlers/
git commit -m "initial jobs and handlers"
```

## Job declarations

Each job is a folder under `~/.config/moadim/jobs/`. The folder name is the job ID.

Each job folder contains an auto-generated `.gitignore` that excludes `*.local.*` and `*.log` files — no manual setup needed.

### `job.toml`

Tracked configuration — schedule, handler, and shared metadata.

```toml
# ~/.config/moadim/jobs/daily-report/job.toml

schedule = "30 9 * * 1-5"   # cron expression (min hour dom month dow)
handler  = "send-report"     # filename in ~/.config/moadim/handlers/ (no extension)
enabled  = true              # omit to default to true

[metadata]
recipient = "team@example.com"
timezone  = "Asia/Jerusalem"
```

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule`   | string | yes      | Cron expression: `min hour dom month dow` or `@hourly`/`@daily`/`@weekly`/`@monthly`/`@yearly`/`@annually`. |
| `handler`    | string | yes      | Script name in `handlers/` (without extension)                         |
| `enabled`    | bool   | no       | Defaults to `true`. Set `false` to pause without deleting.             |
| `[metadata]` | table  | no       | Key/value pairs passed to the handler as `MOADIM_*` env vars.          |

### `job.local.toml`

Untracked overrides — machine-specific values or secrets that should not be committed. Loaded after `job.toml`; local values win on any conflict.

```toml
# ~/.config/moadim/jobs/daily-report/job.local.toml

enabled = false           # overrides job.toml enabled = true → job is paused locally

[metadata]
api_key = "sk-..."        # secret — never commit
recipient = "me@local"    # overrides job.toml recipient
```

### `job.local.log`

Append-only log written by the server on each run. Gitignored via `*.local.*`. Readable in the UI via the LOGS button or `GET /api/v1/cron-jobs/{id}/logs`.

```
2026-06-11T09:30:00Z [daily-report] run started
2026-06-11T09:30:01Z [daily-report] run finished OK (1.2s)
```

## Routines

> _Cron jobs run a script. Routines run an agent._

A **routine** is a scheduled AI-agent task — the agent-driven sibling of a cron
job. Where a job fires a handler script, a routine fires a prompt at a coding
agent (e.g. Claude) on a cron schedule, each run inside its own throwaway
workbench.

Routines are stored as folders under `~/.config/moadim/routines/<id>/`,
git-trackable just like jobs:

```
~/.config/moadim/routines/
└── nightly-triage/
    ├── routine.toml   # tracked — schedule, agent, prompt, repositories
    ├── prompt.md      # tracked — the rendered prompt handed to the agent
    ├── run.sh         # generated — the crontab entry invokes this
    └── .gitignore     # generated — excludes *.local.* and *.log
```

| Field          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule`     | string | yes      | Cron expression (`min hour dom month dow` or `@daily`, …), evaluated in the host's local timezone — **not** UTC. |
| `title`        | string | yes      | Human name; slugified to name the run workbench and tmux session.                            |
| `agent`        | string | yes      | Agent registry key (e.g. `claude`), resolved from `~/.config/moadim/agents/<agent>.toml`.    |
| `prompt`       | string | yes      | The task prompt handed to the agent.                                                          |
| `repositories` | list   | no       | Git repos listed in the prompt as context. Moadim does **not** clone them — the agent does.   |
| `enabled`      | bool   | no       | Defaults to `true`. Set `false` to pause without deleting.                                    |
| `ttl_secs`     | int    | no       | How long a finished run's workbench is retained before auto-cleanup. Caps the cron-derived retention lower — it can only shorten, never extend it. `None` uses the cron-derived value. |
| `max_runtime_secs` | int | no       | Max wall-clock seconds a single run may execute before the cleanup watchdog force-kills its (hung) tmux session; the workbench is then reaped under the normal TTL rules. Caps the cron-derived runtime (`min(MAX_RUNTIME_SECS, cron interval)`) lower — it can only shorten, never extend it. `None` uses the cron-derived value. |

**Workbenches and cleanup:** each run executes in a workbench under
`~/.config/moadim/workbenches/`. Finished, expired workbenches are reaped on an
hourly sweep so they don't accumulate; trigger a sweep on demand with
`moadim cleanup`. Sessions still running are never reaped.

**REST** — under the `/api/v1` prefix:

```
GET    /routines              # list (filter by ?repository=, sort by ?sort=/&order=)
POST   /routines              # create
GET    /routines/{id}         # fetch one
PUT    /routines/{id}         # replace
PATCH  /routines/{id}         # update fields
DELETE /routines/{id}         # delete
POST   /routines/{id}/trigger # run now, outside the schedule
GET    /routines/{id}/logs    # run output
POST   /routines/cleanup      # reap expired workbenches now
GET    /agents                # list registered agents
GET    /routines.ics          # subscribe to fire times as a calendar feed
```

**MCP** — the same operations are exposed as tools: `list_routines`,
`get_routine`, `create_routine`, `update_routine`, `delete_routine`,
`trigger_routine`, and `cleanup_routines`.

**Agents:** the `agent` field resolves to a config at
`~/.config/moadim/agents/<agent>.toml`. API responses include
`agent_registered` so callers can tell whether the named agent is configured on
the host.

## Running

Moadim runs as a local daemon. By default it starts **in the background**:

```sh
moadim                 # start detached, print the PID, return to the shell
moadim --interactive   # run in the foreground, attached to the terminal (Ctrl-C to stop)
moadim status          # report whether a server is running
moadim status --json   # same, as a machine-readable JSON object
moadim cleanup         # reap finished, expired routine workbenches now
moadim cleanup --json  # same, as a machine-readable JSON object
moadim restart         # stop a running server (if any) and start a fresh one
moadim stop            # ask a running server to stop
moadim stop --json     # same, as a machine-readable JSON object
```

| Command            | Mode          | Behaviour |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|
| `moadim`           | background    | Spawns a detached server, writes its PID to `~/.config/moadim/moadim.pid`, logs to `~/.config/moadim/daemon.log`, and exits. Refuses to start if one is already running. |
| `moadim -i`        | interactive   | Runs in the foreground; logs to the terminal; Ctrl-C stops it. |
| `moadim restart`   | background    | Stops the running server (if any) and spawns a fresh detached instance, so you get a clean process without a separate stop/start. Prints the PID rotation as `restarted: pid <old> -> <new>` (old reads `none` when nothing was running) so scripts/logs can confirm the process actually changed. |
| `moadim stop`      | —             | Sends `POST /shutdown` to the running server for a graceful stop. Add `--json` for `{"running":bool,"pid":N\|null,"address":"127.0.0.1:5784"}` (matching `status --json`'s shape; the `pid` is read before the shutdown request, since a graceful stop clears the pid file). Exits `0` when a running server was asked to shut down, `3` when none was reachable. |
| `moadim status`    | —             | Prints whether a server is reachable on `127.0.0.1:5784`. Add `--json` for `{"running":bool,"pid":N\|null,"address":"127.0.0.1:5784"}`. Exits `0` when running, `3` when not. |
| `moadim cleanup`   | —             | Sends `POST /api/v1/routines/cleanup` to the running server and prints how many finished, expired routine workbenches were reaped (the on-demand version of the hourly sweep). Add `--json` for `{"running":bool,"removed":N}`. Exits `0` when running, `3` when not. |

`status`, `cleanup`, and `stop` follow a script-friendly exit-code contract so callers can branch
on `$?` without parsing stdout: they exit `0` when a server is running (and `cleanup` swept, `stop`
asked it to shut down) and `3` when no server is reachable. Any other failure exits non-zero (`1`)
with a message on stderr.

### Scripting

`status`, `cleanup`, and `stop` each accept `--json` for a single-line, machine-readable object
on stdout. Paired with the exit codes above, a caller gets the full contract without parsing prose:

| Command            | `--json` shape | Exit codes |
|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| `moadim status --json`  | `{"running":bool,"pid":N\|null,"address":"127.0.0.1:5784"}` — `pid` is `null` when no pid file is present | `0` running, `3` not |
| `moadim cleanup --json` | `{"running":bool,"removed":N}` — `removed` is `0` when no server is running | `0` running, `3` not |
| `moadim stop --json`    | `{"running":bool,"pid":N\|null,"address":"127.0.0.1:5784"}` — same shape as `status --json`; `running` is `true` when a running server was asked to shut down; `pid` is the stopped server's PID (read before shutdown) or `null` when none was reachable | `0` running, `3` not |

Any other failure exits `1` with a message on stderr. The object is always a single line, so
`moadim status --json | jq -r .pid` and similar pipelines work without buffering.

Putting the contract to use — branch on the exit code, then read the JSON only when you need a field:

```sh
# Start the server only if one isn't already running (status exits 3 when not).
if ! moadim status --json >/dev/null; then
  moadim
fi

# Grab the running server's PID for a downstream check (empty when not running).
pid=$(moadim status --json | jq -r '.pid // empty')

# Reap expired routine workbenches and report how many were freed.
removed=$(moadim cleanup --json | jq -r .removed)
echo "moadim: reaped ${removed} workbench(es)"
```

Because the default mode is detached, you stop the server **from the client**:
press the **STOP** button in the UI header, run `moadim stop`, or send
`POST /shutdown`. (During development, `cargo run -- --interactive` keeps it in
the foreground.)

Starts on `http://127.0.0.1:5784`. On startup the server:

1. Loads all jobs from `~/.config/moadim/jobs/`.
2. Reads your crontab and applies any changes made to the moadim block while the server was stopped.
3. Writes all enabled managed jobs back into the crontab block.

## MCP usage

> _This is where the loop closes: your agent reads, schedules, and re-fires its own jobs. Loop engineering with a daemon in the middle._

The server exposes an MCP endpoint at `http://localhost:5784/mcp`. Connect any MCP-compatible client.

### Claude Code

Add moadim at **user scope** so it's available across all your projects. moadim is a global daemon (one local server, one crontab) — there's no per-project state, so project scope would only force you to re-add it in every repo.

```sh
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http moadim http://localhost:5784/mcp
```

### Any MCP client

```
transport: streamable-http
url:       http://localhost:5784/mcp
```
