# TODOs

> _Today's TODO, tomorrow's changelog. Ship one, dream up two._

This is a list of todos for consumption, in a pr remove the todo you have implemented and add any new ones you think of.

- Add a way to see all the routines in the UI as a calendar view
- Add spell check for pre commit
- Add validation dialog before shutdown
- Add an endpoint/CLI to trigger workbench cleanup on demand (not only the hourly sweep)
- Add change log
- Add a TTL preset row (1h / 1d / 7d / 30d) under the WORKBENCH TTL input in the routine form, mirroring the cron schedule presets
- Show a humanized retention countdown ("expires in 2d" / "expired") per finished run in the routine LOGS view, derived from the run's finish time and the routine's effective TTL
