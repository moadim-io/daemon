# moadim vs. the alternatives

Feature comparison: scheduling AI agents on a recurring basis.
moadim's niche is **routines** — a prompt + schedule + coding agent that runs
unattended in a throwaway workbench, locally, with no cloud dependency.

✅ first-class  ⚠️ partial / DIY  ❌ not supported

¹ Claude Code routines / cloud agents / `/schedule` skill. ² Codex/Hermes
standalone, n8n, Temporal, Airflow, etc.

## Where each wins

- **cron / systemd timers** — bedrock for scripts. Zero deps, everywhere. No
  agent concept, no isolation, no API, no UI. moadim *sits on top* (syncs to the
  OS crontab) rather than replacing it.
- **GitHub Actions (cron)** — best when work is already CI-shaped and cloud is
  fine: fresh runners, secrets, repo-tracked YAML. Weak for local/offline,
  interactive agents, and sub-hour reliability; minute-billed.
- **Claude Code scheduling** — tight Claude integration, managed auth. Locked to
  Claude; not agent-agnostic; no unified local UI+REST+MCP surface; no `.ics`.
- **Other agent runners (n8n / Temporal / Airflow / Codex-Hermes standalone)** —
  powerful for complex DAGs/durable workflows, but heavier infra and usually
  single-vendor or not agent-prompt-native.

## Where moadim wins

- **Purpose-built for agent routines** — a prompt + schedule + coding agent,
  synced to the OS crontab, on the same daemon and port as the REST/MCP/UI surface.
- **Agent-agnostic** — `claude`, `codex`, `hermes` built in; any CLI via a
  `<name>.toml`. Swap the agent without touching the schedule.
- **Local-first, self-hosted, free** — no cloud, no per-minute billing, runs
  offline against the host crontab.
- **Three interfaces, one port** — UI + REST + MCP with no logic duplication. MCP
  means an agent can read, schedule, and re-fire its **own** routines.
- **Unattended by design** — per-run throwaway workbench (reaped hourly), tmux
  session, pre-seeded Claude trust/MCP approvals so the session never blocks.
- **Ops niceties** — `.ics` feed of fire times, `machines` targeting, run-now
  trigger, `max_runtime_secs` kill cap, `ttl_secs` retention.

## When NOT to pick moadim

- You need cloud-hosted execution with no always-on local machine → GitHub
  Actions / Claude cloud agents.
- You need durable, multi-step DAG orchestration with retries/backfill →
  Temporal / Airflow.
- You only ever run plain scripts and want zero new software → raw cron.
